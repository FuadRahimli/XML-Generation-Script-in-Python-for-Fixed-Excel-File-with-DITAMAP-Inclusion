I've developed a Python script meticulously aligned with the specifications outlined by the product owner and senior team members. This script is purpose-built for a meticulously defined Excel file, where column names and numbers are fixed and explicitly stated. Any deviation from these specifications may disrupt the script's seamless execution.

Dynamically processing each row of the Excel file, the script generates XML files, uniquely named based on the values in the "AlarmId NetAct" column, which serves as the key identifier. The script exhibits adaptability, handling diverse scenarios, including those with empty rows, ensuring robust functionality with a singular Excel file.

Critical expectations include the Excel file incorporating a "Alarm_list" sheet and designating the "AlarmID NetAct" column as the primary key. Following XML file creation, a DITAMAP is automatically generated, containing references to all XML files, maintaining conformity with standard XML and DITAMAP file structures.

To enhance efficiency, the script strategically utilizes the "pandas" and "xml.dom.minidom" libraries, collectively streamlining data processing, XML document creation, file operations, and command-line input handling.

This script has undergone rigorous testing, affirming its flawless execution in Visual Studio and its compatibility with the Oxygen XML Editor. It stands as a robust solution that fully adheres to the specified requirements.

Achievements: 
Thanks to this task, I have improved a range of skills including Python Programming, Data Processing, XML Handling, File Operations, Libraries Integration, Problem Solving, Testing, Documentation, and Automation.
